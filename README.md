# (Study of) Router for Maquette

(Not for production use)

Inspired by [hyperapp](https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp)'s [hyperapp-router](https://github.com/hyperapp/router), I implemented similar router logic for [Maquette](https://maquettejs.org/) as my study.

In fact, most of code in [maquette-router.js](maquette-router.js) are borrowed from [hyperapp-router](https://github.com/hyperapp/router).

I really appreciate [jorgebucaran](https://github.com/jorgebucaran)'s work.
